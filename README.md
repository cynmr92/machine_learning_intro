# Bias vs Variance
Bias has to do with oversimplification whereas variance error is due to adding much complexity. As you increase one you decrease the other one


# What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?
Supervised ML relies on a labelled output (or target) whereas unsupervised isn't targeting something specific

# Precision vs Recall
Precision = positive predictive value (Precision = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive); relevant found/found
Recal = true positive rate (Recall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative); relevant found/relevant
